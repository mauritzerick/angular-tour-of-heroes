## Introduction

I love working with Javascript and the Web. From DOM Manipulation, CSS stylings, as well as understanding the implementation of CRUD system of the web. The best way to master things is to learn it yourself and get your hands dirty. That being said, I would like to thank Rob and Liz to give me a chance to learn Angular by giving me this tutorial :)

## What's inside

The Tour of Heroes tutorial helps me to understand how to build a web app with Angular Framework and develop an application using Angular CLI tool, and provides brief introduction of the CRUD system.

This tutorial helps me to do the following:

1. Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of items
2. Create Angular components and show the heroes/values using an array
3. Data binding
4. Format a data with wipes function
5. Implementing routes to navigate within different components

## Creating a new workspace

```
ng new angular-tour-of-heroes
```

## Run the server locally

```
ng serve --open
```

## Creating neccessary components

```
ng generate components heroes
```
