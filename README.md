This project was created to learn and understand Angular Framework as well as a technical challenge from Winning Group.

## Introduction

I love working with Javascript and the Web. From DOM Manipulation, CSS stylings, as well as understanding the implementation of CRUD system of the web. The best way to master things is to learn it yourself and get your hands dirty. That being said, I would like to thank Rob and Liz to give me a chance to learn Angular by giving me this tutorial :) 

## Live Demo

## What's inside

The Tour of Heroes tutorial helps me to understand how to build a web app with Angular Framework and develop an application using Angular CLI tool, and provides brief introduction of the CRUD system.

This tutorial helps me to do the following:

1. Use built-in Angular directives to show and hide elements and display lists of items
2. Create Angular components and show the heroes/values using an array
3. Data binding
4. Format a data with wipes function
5. Implementing routes to navigate within different components

Current challenges
1. Unsure why I have to deploy with "docs" as the outputPath in the .json file
2. The required assets e.g. Winning group logo is in both app's asset folder and doc's asset folder but it is not showing on the deployed page.
3. Required assets is working locally but not on the live demo.
